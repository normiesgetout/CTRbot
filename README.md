# CTRbot
some bot for shilling or whatever

use: Load cancer from the 4chan API like dis 
`./CTRbot -scrape "http(s)://a.4cdn.org/board/pagenumber.json"` 
replace board and pagenumber with you know

if you're just interpreting with go you can replace ./CTRbot with `go run main.go` of course.

Oh and you can tweak some shit with the algorithm, just bring up the help menu `./CTRbot --help` and you can get more options
