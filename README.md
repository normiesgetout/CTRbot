# CTRbot
some bot for shilling or whatever

use: Init and load the trainer file with cancer from the 4chan API like dis 
`./CTRbot -scrape "http(s)://a.4cdn.org/board/pagenumber.json"` 
replace board and pagenumber with you know

if you're just interpreting with go you can replace ./CTRbot with `go run main.go` of course.

then you're all set to run it normally `./CTRbot` and it will generate some keks

The more you train it, the better it will be

Oh and you can tweak some shit with the algorithm, just bring up the help menu `./CTRbot --help` and you can get more options
